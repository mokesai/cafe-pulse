# Project State

## Current Status: Ready to Execute
## Current Milestone: 1.0 - Multi-Tenant MVP
## Current Phase: 10 — Tenant Foundation (planned, ready to execute)
## Last Updated: 2026-02-12

## Completed
- [x] PROJECT.md created
- [x] ROADMAP.md with 7 phases
- [x] Phase 10 researched (10-RESEARCH.md)
- [x] Phase 10 planned — 7 plans across 4 waves, verified by plan checker

### Decisions Made
- **Tenant context via custom header**: Pass `x-tenant-id` header to Supabase client; `db-pre-request` function reads it and calls `set_config('app.tenant_id', ...)`
- **Subdomain routing**: `slug.localhost:3000` for dev (no /etc/hosts needed)
- **Caching**: Follow existing `globalThis` + TTL pattern from `siteSettings.edge.ts`, 60s TTL
- **Credential storage**: Plain columns for now, Vault migration in later phase
- **Default tenant**: Little Cafe seeded with deterministic UUID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`
- **Unknown subdomains**: Return 404 (not fallback to default tenant)

## Next Action
